          <p>Hi, I'm Kate — just a girl who loves being a part of teams building cool stuff.</p>
          <p>I've spent the past 3+ years at the intersection of food and tech, helping restaurants get tools that actually work for them and helping diners eat better. Having worked in restaurants since I was 16, this was the perfect way to blend the hospitality industry with my tech experiences. And the shoe fits!</p>
          <p>When I'm not hunting for a new favorite bite, I'm probably deep in a founder podcast, pinning my fifth Pinterest board of the week, scrolling on The Real Real, or convincing my friends to try the Ninja Park in Greenpoint (no takers yet. but we'll get there.). I was born in Boston, went to USC, lived in Sydney for a bit, and eventually landed in NYC.</p>
          <p>I'm always looking for new friends, mentors, mentees, and generally excellent people to add to my life. If that sounds like you, <a href="mailto:kate.eliz.simon@gmail.com" class="inline-link">hit my line.</a></p>
